        <h1>Golgappa / Pani Puri / Puchka</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>Trip to Delhi in North India can never be complete without having the Golgappa there â€“ one of the most popular street food snacks. Not just this, while a Golgappa Recipe is a typical Delhi way of making it, this dish is famous under different names in other parts of India. So, it becomes the quintessential pani puri in Maharashtra, puchka in West Bengal and gupchup in Bihar and Jharkhand. In this recipe, I have also shared the way to make a tangy, yummy Golgappa Pani an essential element of any Golgappa meal. The golgappa pani or spicy water is made of mint leaves in some places and in some places its jaljeera pani or hing pani or amchur (dried mango) pani. The meetha pani is the usual sweet tamarind chutney. The Golgappa puri can be made of atta (whole wheat flour) or sooji/rava (cream of wheat or semolina). You can use either. The atta golgappe are bigger in size than the ones made with sooji.
