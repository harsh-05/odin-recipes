    <p>Misal pav is a popular Maharashtrian street food of usal (sprouts curry) topped with onions, tomatoes, farsan (fried savory mixture), lemon juice, coriander leaves and served with a side of soft pav (Indian dinner rolls). The sprouts curry is made from moth bean sprouts. This misal recipe is a tasty and filling vegan dish that can be served as breakfast, lunch or brunch. The word “Misal” here is for the sprouts curry and Pav are Indian dinner rolls. Actually, in the Marathi language, the word misal means mixture. This sprouts curry is also called as usal. There are many variations of making misal pav in Maharashtra. Usually, moth bean sprouts (also known as matki in Marathi language) is used to make the misal. But if you don’t have sprouted moth beans then make the misal recipe with mixed beans sprouts or sprouted moong beans.</p>
