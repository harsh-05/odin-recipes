            <p>Paneer Tikka is a popular and delicious tandoori snack where Paneer (Indian cottage cheese cubes) are marinated in a spiced yogurt-based marinade, arranged on skewers and grilled in the oven. Worry not if you don't have an oven  instead of grilling in oven, you can make Paneer Tikka Recipe on stovetop on a tawa/skillet. Tikka basically means anything that is marinated and then baked or grilled or fried and paneer tikka is a popular vegetarian tikka dish.</p>
