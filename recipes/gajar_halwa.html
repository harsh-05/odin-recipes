        <hr>
        <p>Carrot halwa is a popular sweet made in North India, and it is especially popular during winters. The traditional gajar ka halwa recipe is made with only carrots, whole (full-fat) milk, ghee and sugar. There's no need for khoya (evaporated milk solids) or condensed milk.</p>
